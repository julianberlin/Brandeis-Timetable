# Brandeis-Timetable
A centralized database for easy access to Brandeis Office Hours

 As undergraduate students at Brandeis University, we desired to create an easier way to acess our professor's office hours. Currently, students view their professor's office hours through Latte, a Brandeis supported aplication. However, if you are not enrolled in a specific professor's course you cannot acess thier latte page and therefore cannot view the professor's office hours. With Brandeis-Timetable, anyone can acess any professor's office hours and the hours of their corresponding TAs.
 
 While still a work in progress, we are proud to show off its current functionality. Currently, you can easily search our Mongo databate for your professors and classes. If you are an admin, you can edit the available courses, inluding the Professor's office hours and the TAs assigned to each course. 
 
 The long term goals of our website inlcuding being able to add courses to a "my courses" section in your profile, including more layers of profiles than just adminds and users, and incorporating a clendar API for the appoitments. In the longer term, we would like to include the hours of other Brandeis associates, including the office hours for the student allocations board, the office hours of Brandeis administrators, and more.
 
 If you would like to see the admins features, you can add your email to the admin schema and the mongoDb.
